In a tiny bowl, mix the baking soda and vanilla together until the baking soda is mostly dissolved. Remove the pot from the heat, and stir in the vanilla and baking soda mixture. The caramel should be very light and frothy. Immediately pour the caramel over the popcorn, and gently fold the caramel into the popcorn to coat it. (At this point, you might think there is not enough caramel for the corn, as there will be globs of caramel, and a lot of the popcorn will not seem well-coated. But don't worry! There will be plenty.). Bake the caramel corn for 15 minutes. Remove the roasting pan from the oven and gently stir the popcorn into the melting caramel until the popcorn is better coated. Return to the oven for another 15 minutes, after which the popcorn should be evenly coated with the caramel. Return the caramel corn to the oven and bake for a final 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and give the corn one final stir to coat thoroughly. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes. When the popcorn is totally cool, it will have a nice, thin, crispy coating.

Add one of the candy coating squares into a ramekin or small bowl that has a diameter slightly larger than the top of the ice cream cone. Melt the candy coating in a microwave for 30 second bursts making sure to stir between each 30 seconds. Dip the top of two of the ice cream cones into the melted candy coating. You may need to tilt the bowl slightly so the coating covers the area that is about an inch to two inches from the top of the cone. Then sprinkle the decorative candies on top of the candy coating. Next, set the bottom of the cone in the candy coating tilting the bowl slightly so the coating covers the area that is about an inch to two inches from the bottom of the cone. Set the bottom of the cone on the parchment paper and let the candy coating dry (about 30 minutes). The candy coating on the bottom helps to give the cone a better \ footing\  so that it doesn't tip over when the popcorn is stacked on the top.

Once popped put the popcorn into a bowl, removing any un-popped kernels, add salt and set aside. Unwrap the caramels and add them to a medium size saucepan. Heat the pan on low to medium heat and stir constantly. Once the caramels start to melt add the water and continue to stir. Once the caramels are totally melted, remove the pan from the heat and set aside for a quick moment. In a small bowl, melt the chocolate chips in a microwave for 30 second bursts making sure to stir between each 30 seconds. Drizzle the caramel in the bottom of the ice cream cones (about 2 teaspoons). Then drizzle the chocolate in the cones (about 2 teaspoons). Next, sprinkle some of the toffee bits in the bottom of the cones. Add the popcorn until it reaches the top of the cone. Then drizzle more of the caramel and chocolate, and top with the a few more toffee bits. Next add as much popcorn to the top of the chocolate that will stick. If you have extra you can add more kernels of popcorn by dipping them in the caramel so they'll stick. When adding them, try to make an overall shape that looks like a scoop of ice cream. Lastly, drizzle any remaining caramel and chocolate over the popcorn and top with toffee bits. The caramel hardens quickly so you may need to warm it up on the stove a couple times in between making the cones.

To make coating the popcorn easier with caramel, place popcorn in warm oven for 5 minutes prior to coating with caramel. I placed the popcorn on the cookie sheets I was going to use to bake in. 3. For the chocolate drizzle, you do not have to use melting wafers. They are just easier to work with. If you are competent enough of a cook to melt chocolate chips (unlike myself), feel free to do so. 4. To stir caramel onto popcorn, you will need a very large bowl.

Even if you think you can't cram one more in, try it; you'll be surprised how many you can fit in, and it will help them keep from floating in the jar. Also, be sure not to use iodized salt, like table salt. It will discolor your pickles over time. Wash the green beans and trim their ends so that they are uniform. If needed, cut them further so that they will fit easily inside of the jars you are using to can them. Divide the beans into sterilized canning jars, along with the garlic, pepper flakes and dill seed. In a small saucepan, bring the vinegars, water and pickling salt to a boil, until the salt dissolves. Pour the pickling mixture over the green beans and cap the jars. Process the jars in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Alternatively, allow to cool and refrigerate. Properly-handled sterilized equipment will keep canned foods in good condition for years.

Its just a hint of sweet, which balances perfectly with the tang of the Greek yogurt and the spice of the Sriracha. Really. Dont be scared. 2. I made my teriyaki sauce a day in advance; it can be refrigerated for up to a week, and then poured over the salmon whenever you want to make it. It is a really delicious teriyaki sauce and would be perfectly delicious for any dish that calls for it. 3.

Add the rice wine and cook until no longer sizzling, just a few minutes. Allow to cool partially before stuffing spring rolls. The dough for spring rolls is different than the dough for egg rolls. I had to find spring roll wrappers at an Asian grocery store. They are vegan (which makes this recipe vegan!) but if you can't find any and don't worry about consuming eggs, egg roll wrappers will work as well. Stuff the rolls according to the directions on the package, or by following these simple instructions; place a single wrapper on a flat surface so that a corner is facing you. Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of filling below the wrapper's midsection. Fold the bottom corner up so that it just encases the filling. Fold the sides in so the wrapper covers the filling and resembles an envelope with a long top. Press gently as you roll the filling upward, encasing it in the remaining dough. If your dough doesn't stick, fill a small bowl with water and use it to lightly wet the dough as you fold during each step. Deep fry three rolls at a time in a \ Fry Daddy\  deep fryer or pan fry in a non-stick pan in one half inch of oil, turning to cook thoroughly. Remove from oil while using either method when the dough has browned evenly but is still light in color. The dough will continue to brown once removed from heat. Serve and enjoy! NOTE: To freeze, place fresh, uncooked spring rolls in a plastic container, separating each roll with wax or parchment paper. You can do this by layering them or by wrapping them. If they touch, the dough will freeze together and ruin your rolls. Once frozen, you can transfer them to a smaller container without the paper. Thaw for several minutes prior to frying.",1

Using your hands, gently tear the tomatoes into medium pieces. When both the citrus slices and tomatoes are ready, put them together into a nonreactive heatproof storage container with the sugar, lemon juice, and saffron, stirring well to combine. Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight. Place a saucer with five metal teaspoons in a flat place in your freezer for testing the marmalade later. Remove the tomato mixture from the refrigerator and transfer it to an 11- or 12-quart copper preserving pan or a wide nonreactive kettle. Add the cinnamon stick and stir well to incorporate any undissolved sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Cook at a rapid boil until the setting point is reached; this will take a minimum of 30 minutes, but may take longer depending on your individual stove and pan. Initially, the mixture will bubble gently for several minutes; then, as more moisture cooks out of it and its sugar concentration increases, it will begin to foam. Do not stir it at all during the initial bubbling; then, once it starts to foam, stir it gently every few minutes with a heatproof rubber spatula. As it gets close to being done, stir it slowly every minute or two to prevent burning, decreasing the heat a tiny bit if necessary. The marmalade is ready for testing when it turns slightly shiny and its bubbles become very small. To test the marmalade for doneness, remove it from the heat and carefully transfer a small representative half-spoonful to one of your frozen spoons. It should look glossy, with tiny bubbles throughout. Replace the spoon in the freezer for 3 to 4 minutes, then remove and carefully feel the underside of the spoon. It should be neither warm nor cold; if still warm, return it to the freezer for a moment. Tilt the spoon vertically to see whether the marmalade runs; if it does not run, and if its top layer has thickened to a jelly consistency, it is done. If it runs, cook it for another few minutes, stirring, and test again as needed. When the marmalade has finished cooking, turn off the heat but do not stir. Using a stainless-steel spoon, skim off any surface foam and discard. Remove the cinnamon stick. Pour the marmalade into sterilized jars and process according to the following instructions. When making preserves, be sure to sterilize your jars and lids, unless you plan to eat your jam right away. Although jams and marmalades are unlikely to become contaminated with anything toxic, it is important to eliminate even the minutest risk. There are many ways to sterilize jars, including putting them in a canning kettle or a sterilizing dishwasher, but my preferred way is in the oven. This method is easier than the other methods and, if you use an oven thermometer, is virtually foolproof. To sterilize jars and lids in the oven, first be sure they are perfectly clean. Place the clean jars upright with an equal number of clean unused lids on a baking sheet or sheet pan in a preheated 250\u00b0F oven. They should remain in the oven for a minimum of 30 minutes to ensure they are heated through. Remove them from the oven right when you need to fill them. After you have filled them, leaving 1/4 inch of room at the top, wipe the rims with a clean, damp cloth. Put the lids on, being careful to screw them on just until they are snug, and replace the jars in the oven for 15 minutes or so to ensure they are completely sterilized. They will seal as they cool. Sometimes the jars can become a little bit too hot when using this method, so before filling them, test their temperature first. Pour a little jam into one, and if it bubbles or boils in the jar, wait a few moments before filling the jars. Upon removing your filled jars from the oven, place them 1 inch apart on a drying rack to set overnight at room temperature. Do not jiggle or disturb them during this time, as this may disrupt their ability to set correctly. As the preserves cool, you may hear a few little pops as the lids seal. Before putting your preserves away, be sure to feel the top of each lid to verify that it has sealed; it should be curving in very slightly in the middle. If any jars have not sealed, put them in the refrigerator for safekeeping. To store sealed preserves, label and date them and keep them in a cool, dark place until you open them. After you open a jar, keep it in the refrigerator. You may also keep higher-sugar preserves at room temperature, assuming you plan to eat them within a few weeks or so. Low-sugar preserves should always be refrigerated once opened, unless you plan to consume them right away.",1

Prepare the chicken and marinade: Remove and discard the fat just inside the neck and body cavities of the chicken. Remove the package of giblets and set it aside for another use. Rinse the chicken, inside and out, under cold running water, then drain and blot it dry, inside and out, with paper towels. Spatchcock the chicken. Make 2 deep slashes to the bone in both sides of the chicken breast and in each leg and thigh. Trim or fold the wing tips back behind the wings. Place the bird in a nonreactive baking dish just large enough to hold it. 2. Place the garlic halves, sugar, and salt in a heavy mortar and pound to a paste with a pestle. Work in the soy sauce and fish sauce. If you do not have a mortar and pestle, combine the garlic, sugar, and salt in a small food processor and puree to a paste, then work in the soy sauce and fish sauce. Spoon the marinade over the chicken, forcing it into the slits and turning the bird to coat it well on both sides. Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 1 hour to 4 hours; the longer it marinates, the richer the flavor will be. 3. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Heat the oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the crushed clove of garlic and cook until just beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic to a small heatproof bowl. Add the annatto seeds to the saucepan with the oil and cook until fragrant and browned and the oil turns orange, about 2 minutes. If you are using paprika instead of annatto seeds, cook it for only 15 seconds. Strain the oil through a fine-mesh wire strainer into the bowl with the garlic. Set the glaze aside. 4. Prepare the dipping sauce: Place 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of sugar, if using, in 2 small attractive bowls. Have the limes ready; you'll add the lime juice at the last minute. (See Note.) 5. Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat it to medium. Leave one section of the grill bare for a safety zone. 6. When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Drain the chicken and discard the marinade and arrange it on the hot grate or in an oiled grill basket, if using, skin side down. Grill the chicken until it is golden brown and cooked through, 12 to 20 minutes per side. Move the chicken as needed to dodge any flare-ups. Use an instant-read meat thermometer to test for doneness, inserting it into the thickest part of a thigh but not so that it touches a bone. The internal temperature should be about 170\u00b0F. Alternatively, you can make a cut in the chicken meat where the thigh connects to the body; there should be no traces of red at the bone. During the last 10 minutes of cooking, start brushing the chicken on both sides with the glaze. 7. To serve, transfer the chicken, skin side up, to a platter. Let it rest for about 2 minutes, then cut it into pieces with a cleaver. Add 2 tablespoons of lime juice to each bowl with the salt, pepper, and sugar for the dipping sauce and stir it with a fork or chopsticks until the salt and sugar dissolves. To eat, dip the pieces of chicken in the salted lime juice. You can also grill the chicken using the indirect method, a process that, although not traditionally Khmer, has the advantage of eliminating all risk of flare-ups. Set up the grill for indirect grilling, place a drip pan in the center, and preheat the grill to medium. Place the marinated chicken skin side up in the center of the grate over the drip pan and away from the heat. Cover the grill and cook the chicken until browned and cooked through, 40 minutes to 1 hour. Start brushing the chicken with the glaze during the last 15 minutes of cooking and baste it again every 5 minutes.",2

Add the chicken and turn it a couple of times in the fat, leaving it skin side up. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and return the pan to the oven. After the chicken has cooked for 15 minutes, toss about one-quarter of the herb, if you're using any, over it and turn the pieces. Sprinkle on another quarter of the herb and roast for another 10 minutes. Turn the chicken over (now skin side up again), add another quarter of the herb, and cook until the chicken is done (you'll see clear juices if you make a small cut in the meat near the bone), a total of 30 to 40 minutes at most. Garnish with the remaining herb and skim excess fat from the pan juices if necessary; serve, with some of the juices spooned over it. ROAST CHICKEN PARTS WITH BLACK BEANS VARIATION: First, soak 2 tablespoons fermented black beans in water, sherry, or wine to cover. In place of the butter or olive oil, use peanut oil or a neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn. Mix together 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 2 minced scallions, 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon sugar or honey. Drain the black beans and add them to this mixture; thin it to a paste, if necessary, with a little more soy sauce. In Step 1, spread a little of this mixture all over the raw chicken and put the chicken in the roasting pan; return the pan to the oven. Proceed with Steps 2 and 3, using the soy-based mixture for basting in place of the herb mixture. MORE VARIATIONS: You can combine these ideas at will; it's hard to go wrong here. Add with the chicken at the beginning of cooking unless otherwise specified. (1) Add a few sprigs of a stronger herb like thyme, sage, oregano, or rosemary. (2) Add several (or many!) cloves of garlic. (3) Add a cup or so of chopped onion, shallot, or leek. (4) Add a cup or so of sliced fresh mushrooms, after the first 15 minutes of roasting. (5) Add a lot of hot dried chiles, a couple of roasted, soaked, and chopped milder chiles, or both. (6) Add 2 or 3 lemons (oranges and limes are good too), cut in half; when the chicken is done, squeeze the hot lemon juice over it. (7) Use peanut oil instead of olive oil and add several slices of ginger and garlic after turning the chicken skin side up again. When chicken is done, drizzle with soy sauce and dark sesame oil, then garnish with scallions and/or cilantro. (8) Use Compound Butter, Flavored Oil, or Vinaigrette from the beginning of the cooking or as a basting sauce during cooking. (9) Rub the chicken with 1/2 cup or so of Pesto or any other herb paste from the beginning of the cooking. (10) Stir in a dollop of grainy French-style mustard when the chicken is done. (11) Add a couple handfuls of cherry tomatoes and some black olives after turning the chicken skin side up again. (12) Stir in a cup of any salsa in the last 10 minutes of cooking or spoon on top of the cooked chicken before serving. (13) Stir a couple tablespoons of any curry powder into a cup of yogurt or coconut milk and spoon or brush it on as a basting sauce during cooking.",3
